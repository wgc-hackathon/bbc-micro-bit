# Program a BBC micro:bit and facilitate covid sequencing in the lab

*Open to all new coders of all ages. No experience necessary!*

## Introduction

Covid variants are starting to pop up all over the world. At the Wellcome Genome Campus Sanger Institute, scientists are racing to identify new potentially dangerous variants in the UK population. They do this using a technology called genome sequencing.

Genome sequencing is a journey from human samples to processing and data analyses, involving many steps in the lab along the way. A bit like baking a cake, things like storage temperature and an incorrectly timed process can mean the difference between a failed experiment and success.

## Objectives

This project aims to use a mini-computer called a BBC micro-bit to help scientists in the lab.

Technology can help scientists in many ways. For example, software developers have built a software called LIMS (Laboratory Information Systems) to track a sample arriving to a lab through to the moment it is processed. Scientists also rely on equipment that has lots of sensors, often controlled by a computer, to help them with their research.

We will take you through a series of activities where you can use your own BBC micro-bit, or a web-based simulator, to help scientists keep their samples at the correct temperature and manage their sequencing data. You will also help solve puzzles - has a new covid-variant been detected?

## Resources

To see covid sequencing in action, see this video: [Sanger Institute - What does it take to sequence tens of thousands of COVID-19 samples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd40gunBTN0)

This diagram also illustrates the journey from sample to data analyses:

An introduction to the BBC micro-bit and some brilliant tutorials can be found in the micro-bit foundation webpage here: https://microbit.org/get-started/first-steps/introduction/. Please note that it is not necessary to own a micro:bit, although if you do, it can certainly be used in the workshop activities.

## What do I need to take part?

[TO DO]
Set-up info.

[To DO]
Include link to discussion forum / chat box where participants can introduce themselves or ask questions
Include link to tutorial where participants write their name

## Outcomes - We hope you enjoy it!

This event is for any new coder, including children and adults. There will be online guidance during the Zoom workshop and we have listed resources below to help if you get stuck. A discussion forum for questions has also been set up here: [add link]. We want you to have fun and find out what it is like to code. You do not need to know how to solve these tasks to be a good coder! And it is as much about creativity and problem solving as it is about learning to write computer code.
